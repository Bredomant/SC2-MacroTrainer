V2.964
Fixes:
	• Fixed an issue which could cause the program to fail if a folder with the name "Starcraft II" was open.
	• After destroying an enemies spawning base those small red squares will no longer be visible on the minimap.

Changes:	
	• Added deselect unit sleep time.
	• Queens will no longer inject on hatcheries which are on a different mapheight to themselves
		e.g. queen on high ground hatch on the low ground
		Note: A queen standing on a ramp will not inject her hatch (even if she is nearby)
	•The normal inject alerts will not be heard if 'force injects' have been enabled. 

V2.963
Changes:
	• Injects:
		The following changes should make the forced/fully-automatic injection more reliable and less intrusive to your game play.
		- Forced (fully automatic) injects will be delayed until after the user finishes casting a spell or placing a structure.
		- Forced injects will be delayed if a menu is open
		- If chat was open, it will be restored post injection
		- Added a separate Forced-Inject sleep time (this should be set as low as reliably possible).
		- UnitSubgroup/highlighted unit (tab position) should be restored after an inject round
		- Keyboard and mouse input sent during a FORCED inject will be buffered and then sent to the game after the injects finishes
			+ Hence mouse movement made during a FORCED inject will influence where the mouse pointer is placed post injection - e.g. if you were doing a down swipe and a forced inject begins, after the injection finishes the mouse should be placed near where the pointer would have been if no inject had occurred.

	• The program should load considerably faster.	

New:
	• New method of input blocking & key buffering.
	• Keys which are blocked or buffered during some automations can be defined in "options -> settings -> Key Blocking"
	• Added a separate Forced-Inject sleep time.
	• Can disable the "Beep if modifier is held down" ability for FORCED injects.

Fixes:
	• Hellbat (listed as HellionTank) ID has been added to the unit detection list.
	• Method of finding SC2 Base address
		- This was likely responsible for some of the "Fail" and "Handle Closed" errors
		- This could previously be caused by having a folder open called "Starcraft II" or having a really slow computer

V2.962
Changes:
	• Reverted to the old inject method (as people have been having issues)
Fixes:
	• Changing hotkeys before launching SC2 will no longer display an error.
	
V2.961
New:
	• Idle Worker Overlay
		- Invisible when no idle workers
		- Increases in size when idle workers increase by 4 (to catch your attention)
		- Similar to the WOL idle worker icon (i find the HotS icon hard to check at a glance)
		
Changes:
	• Updated offsets for HOTS 2.0.7
	• Chronoboost:
		- Warpgates with the highest cool down will be chronod first
		- Only warpgates which are on cool down will be chronod 
		(gateways will be chronod afterwards)
		- Warpgates and Gateways which are currently chornod will not be 're-chronod'
			i.e. they will be skipped.
			
	• Worker production Macro:
		- Terran and Protoss will now be warned when ALL bases have been
			idle for a set period of time.
		- Idle means no worker in production and the bases are not flying or morphing.
		- Zerg still uses the old method i.e. a warning is made if a drone has not been
			built in the last X seconds. Sorry, the zerg unit build method is different to T & P.
	

Fixes:
	• Overlays will adjust size properly on mouse scroll (as they previously did)
	• Hotkeys:
		- When changing hotkeys, the previously bound key should now deactivate without a restart
	• Hotkey & Send Key GUI:
		- The key ' 0 ' can now be used i.e. the 'accept' button will remain clickable.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
V2.96

Changes:
	• Added HotS units to the program
	• All compliant 16:10, 16:9, 5:4, and 4:3 resolutions should now be supported.
New:
	• Select Army Function:
		This will select your entire army and can then do any of the following:
		- Remove units controlling Xelnage towers 
		- Remove patrolling units
		- Remove units on hold position
		- Remove units set to follow
		- Remove types of units e.g. burrowed swarmhost
		- Add the final selection to a control group
	
	• Army split function:
		- ** This is only VERY very beta, and it's included as it works OK for me.
	These functions can be found in the options menu under "Misc Automation"

V2.952

Changes:
	• Updated Memory offsets for WOL 2.0.5 Patch


V2.951

Changes:
	• Units can now be drawn with their colours 'blended together' like SC2 does.
		- This option is enabled by default
	• Units should be better drawn on the minimap
		- More appropriate  unit sizes and shapes
	• Added a third unit list for custom minimap colours.
		- This can be used to highlight certain units with a specific colour on the minimap
		
Fixes:	
	• Minimap and overlays should be displayed properly if the user is alt tabbed out at the start of the game (or any time)
	• Idle Worker memory offset.

	Note: A big thanks to Mr. Nuke for providing his minmap drawing methods and help!

V2.95

Fixes:
	• 'Collosus' typo in the unit name list(Colossus). 
		- If this was in your 'auto unit grouping' list you will need to correct the spelling/re-add the unit.
Changes:
	• Updated Memory offsets for new WOL 2.0.4 Patch
	• Unit Detection list now uses UnitID names, rather than ID codes
		-  Your unit detection list will be overwritten with this update!
		
Note:
	I haven't done much testing, so there may still be some bugs.
	But I will endeavor to fix these as they come to light.
	Cheers.
	
V2.942
Sorry for these annoying upgrades - I forgot to fix these two things.
Fixes:
• Spawning race pictures will be drawn for the correct amount of time.
• A couple of minor errors in the included ini file.

V2.941
New:

• Added an optional delay to Auto Unit Grouping.
	- This can be used to make the function appear more human. 
Changes:
• Previous warning Hotkey will now display the minimap location (in addition to the verbal warning)
• Limit Grouping can now be set for individual control groups.
• If the program's settings are changed i.e. 'saved' or 'applied' during a match:
	- Previously detected units (and timed out units) will no longer be (re)warned.
	- Spawning races will no longer be read/displayed again.
	
Fixes:
• Having a 'non-auto-groupable' unit selected with a 'groupable' unit will no longer trigger the auto group function.
	- In other words, the function won't group incorrect units.
	(sorry, I only just discovered this phenomenon)
• Modified the user input blocking mechanism (again!):
	- The Left mouse button state should be correctly restored following injects/chronos e.g. during box drags

V2.94
New:
• Added the ability to temporarily disable the minimap
	- This allows you to check if you have legitimately seen a unit.
	
Changes:
• Injection Methods:
	• Backspace:
		- Has been made more intelligent.
		- No longer spams the (temporary unit storage group)
		- Is far more robust than the 'backspace-advance/ctrlgroup' method.
	• Backspace Advanced:
		- Renamed to 'Backspace CtrlGroup'
		- Has been made more reliable.
		

• If the program is reloaded ('Lwin & Space' x3) during a match:
	- Previously detected units (and timed out units) will no longer be (re)warned.
	- Spawning races will no longer be displayed nor read aloud.

To help resolve the 'sticky key' issue once and for all, the following 
changes have been made:
	• AutoGrouping:
		- Units will be added after the modifier (shift, ctrl, alt, & windows) keys  have been released
	• Injects, Chrono & AutoMine:
		- A warning will sound indicating a modifier key is being held down.
		- The macro will begin once the modifier key is released.
		- Keyboard and mouse input blocking methods has been changed and are enabled for these macros
Fixes:
• Fixed a bug affecting the number of 'secondary' macro warnings e.g. supply, money, gas	

V2.93
New:
• New injection method 'Backspace Advanced':
	- This is like the true backspace method, and a hybrid of the existing 'backspace' and 'minimap' methods.
	- Queens need to be hotkeyed.
	- Hatches without a HOTKEYED queen (or have a queen with inadequate energy) will not be injected.
• New "MiniMap" method has been added to auto mine function.
	- This is compatible with all resolutions and uses the minimap to mine.
	- It uses a combination of SC2 unit location and pixel searching.
• Auto Mine:
	- Worker split types now available: 6x1, 3x2, or 2x3
	- The program will now attempt to rally workers to the closet patches first.
	- The program will now attempt to rally the nexus/hatch/cc to the inner/middle patches first.
	- Making 1st worker is now optional	
	**Note: Due to the difficult nature of calculating mouse clicks in a 3d environment,
			other patches will be used when the above cannot be hit/clicked.
			
Fix:
• Larva Injection - MiniMap and Backspace Advanced methods will only inject hatcheries which have a HOTKEYED queen present (as apposed to any queen).
	- This further prevents queens going walkabout.
• Unit Detection Warnings:
	- Specifically when using multiple warnings for the same unit/building (based on time of production)
	- For example 6, 12, 14 pool warnings can all exist together and work properly without interfering with one another.
• The forced (i.e. fully automated) inject off/toggle hotkey will now work with the backspace methods.
• Auto Mine (& rally) should be (far) more accurate - at least the 'normal method' is.
• Auto Game pause if user is idle (at start) has been re-enabled/fixed.
• Mouse input/movement will be blocked during fully automated i.e. forced injects. (like it use to be)
• Sticky keys - Although this problem is much better than it once was, on occasion keys (particularly the ctrl key) can still become 
	temporarily stuck down.
	- Pressing the affected key or using the reset function will fix it, but I have added another routine which should help further with this issue.


V2.921:
Change:
• Updated memory addresses for patch 1.5.4

Note: 
• I didn't test this much, but it seems fine.
• V2.93 Is almost ready. It will contain a few fixes and improvements, particularly regarding the auto mine feature.

V2.92
New:
• Hotkey to playback the last detected/unit-alert message. (detected units)

Fix/Change:
• The Ctrl/shift key 'sticking' while using auto-group should be better/fixed.
• Optimised Minimap Drawing rate - ~13% performance increase
• Minor code/speed improvements
• Minor overlay bugs:	- Not toggling name identifier via hotkey
						- Clipping of the right edge
• Activation of the SC2 window  in conjunction with auto mine on game commencement should work better with slow computers						
• User defined unit (control) groups will no longer be lost/blanked when updating versions.
• Compiled using (the new) AHK(_L) v1.1.09.00

v2.9

New:
• Restricted Unit Grouping
	- This prevents users incorrectly grouping units to a control group e.g. an scv with your orbitals
	- It can be used in conjunction with Auto Grouping or alone. 

Fixes:
• Fully automated injects will only occur if sc2 is the active window i.e. you're in game
• Open Chatbox will not interfere with injects
• Fixed sticky keys/mouse-buttons and loss of user input (hopefully)
• Program no longer requires administrator privileges

V2.81

Fixes: 	A bug which would crash the program when chronoing gates.
		A menu bug.

V2.8

New:
• Enemy units can be displayed on the minimap
• Unit and forgotten gateway alerts can be drawn on the minimap
• Added Resource, Income, Army, and (local) Worker overlays
• Added 'Misc' ability to bring the game window to foreground on match commencement
	Note: This is performed automatically when using 'auto mine'	
• Supply warning will not be made if a Supply depot or pylon is in production. Sorry zergs.	
	
Fixes:
• Auto Grouping units using control group 0 will now work
• Playing a game while having the options menu open will no longer cause warnigs (money/supply etc) to occur more frequently than set.
• Various menu

Future Changes:
• Cancel supply warnings if an overlord is in production.
• Addition of classes

V2.71

New:
• Added hotkey to disable/re-enable fully automated 'forced' injects while in game. (Lwin & F5)

Fixes:
• Emergency Unlock and Restart Button "Left windows & Space" ***
	-When pressed once, it should restore user input if a key has become artificially stuck OR user input is erroneously blocked
	-When pressed three times, it will restart the program. (If error persists, then it's not this program)
	-Please read the 'Emergency' Tab in the options menu.
• The program 'should' be FAR more robust against 'sticky' keys and losing input.
	-Changed coding used to generate certain inputs 
	-Added a release and restore modifier-key-state function which should prevent sticky keys.
	-This should improve all macros.
• Simulation Speed has been replaced with 'Key Delays'.
• Fixed an oversight which resulted in user input being blocked when Auto Mine was enabled, and your opponent left before the game began
• Auto Mining should Now work MUCH better.

V2.7

Note:
***	For greater capability, the method of artificial input defaults to "Event". 
	For better performance and user input buffering please use "Input" (providing this works with your system)
	This option is found under " Settings & Options --> Settings --> Input Method "

New:
• Intelligent MiniMap larva Inject - This should prevent or at least reduce the likelihood of queens going walkabout.
	(only hatcheries with a nearby hot keyed queen which has adequate energy will be injected)
• Fully automated ('forced') injects. No user input required!
• Auto Mine
• Chronoboost Gates 
• Auto Group Units - Adds units and buildings to predetermined control groups.
• Alert Location - Press F7 to find the minimap position of an alert or an unconverted gateway
• Enemy races can now be automatically read at the start of the game
• FFA Detection list has been added.
• Admin privileges are now required.
• Added player colour to the alert message

Fixes:
• The program should now be compatible with custom games, including those with free/empty player slots, spectators, observers, and referees.
• Fixed an issue which resulted in values changing for user Idle time and additional delay times (supply, minerals etc) when entering the options menu and leaving without saving.
	(this caused the follow up warnings to be spoken without the proper delay.)
	**** Please Check that your "secondary delay" is set to a reasonable amount e.g. 10, not 1! (As I cannot change user set preference.) *****
• The 'Auto Game Pause - if user is idle' function has been disabled until I can be bothered working out why it's not working properly.

V2.61

• Updated memory offsets for SC2 1.53
• The enemy races can now be automatically read at the start of the game

Fixes:
• Fixed an oversight with a memory offset which could result in no 'Unit Detection Warning' being issued early on in the match.
• Modified the user idle function.

Note: I noticed a small 'error' in the predefined unit detection list. As user detection lists are automatically transferred between updates, it's 
easier if you change these values for yourself.

The 'Don't Warn If Made After' parameter for the  "Early Pool" is "80", while the "Don't warn if exists before" parameter for 14 Pool is 110.
This will mean that no alert will be given if a pool is made between 80 and 110 seconds.
To rectify this, simply change the 'Don't Warn If Made After' for "Early Pool" to "109". 

V2.6

• Added the optional parameters "Dont Warn Before" and "Dont Warn After" (a specified game time) to the detection system.
	This allows for warnings such as "6 pool", "8 pool", and "14 pool" to all exist together
• All New GUI which contains all the program's settings. No need to edit the config file!
• New GUI alert list editor. Easily add alerts to various game modes with just a click of the mouse!
• New simple GUI to change hotkeys / send keys.
• Have included the 'beep wav' hopefully this fixes some people not hearing the inject alert.
• The inject alert can now be set to a beep and/or a spoken warning. (helpful if your system can't play the beep sound)

Note: When updating to 2.6, your previous alert list will not be incorporated into the new config file (a copy will be retained in the ‘backup folder’).


V2.53

• Added the optional parameters "Dont Warn Before" and "Dont Warn After" (a specified game time) to the dectection system.
	This allows for warnings such as "6 pool", "8 pool", and "14 pool" to all exist together
• Camera position is now correctly restored after an inject round (bug may have only affected my test vr).
• When updating, the users personalised config settings (including warning lists) are transferred to the new config file.
• Copy2clipboard=0 now actually disables copying the detected unit to the clipboard 
• No longer receive "idle" warning at the start of a game.


V2.52

• Added the ability to set the drag origin to the right top corner via config setting drag_origin=Right (hence now compatible with observer panel hacks)
• Made the inject macro thread critical/non-interruptible
• During the inject sequence all user keyboard and mouse input will be blocked (if the program is ran as an administrator).

V2.51

• Fixed the auto detect local player function
• Warnings will no longer be heard during replays

V2.5

• Program now auto detects local player name
• Speech and Overall program volumes can now be set via the config file.
• Added volume up/down commands for the overall program (beeps), speech, and speakers/system
• The auto inject hotkey is only active while playing zerg (so in SC2 it can be bound to something else for the other races)
• Added function to read enemy's worker count (only in 1v1)
• Removed the non_automated inject function i.e. It will always read read the base count
• Changed the Soundplay setting to play a system wav
• Added stealth mode which hides the Tray Icon, and activates an exit hotkey - hence you can cheat at LANs.
• Added an update feature - Right click the Tray icon and select "Check For Updates"
• Program automatically checks for updates. (unless disabled via config file)

V2.42

• Updated the memory addresses for SC vr 1.5.1

V2.41
• Changed the auto inject macro - building queens (at queenless hatcheries) will no longer be cancelled 
• Fixed the incorrect naming/ID of some of the units in the config file (nydus and spire)
• Added the ability to set the overall volume for the program, and speech volume independently
• Added the option to specify the 'send mode' used for simulated keystrokes to increase compatibility - they are event, input, or play 

V2.4
• Updated the memory addresses for SC v1.5
• Added race specific voice alerts for worker production

V2.3
• Major rewrite of the code structure and flow
• Added a minimum supply threshold before (supply) warnings are invoked
• Added the ability to issue warnings for gateways which have yet to be (i.e. forgotten to be) converted to warpgates
• Added an enemy unit and building detection system
• Enabled the program to backup the old config file when updating.

V2.2
• Added the ability to read opponents races
• Fixed a bug which paused the game when the user was not idle (due to peculiarity with A_TimeIdlePhysical in AHK)
• Updated the in game clock to a reliable timer (this bug affected numerous functions)
